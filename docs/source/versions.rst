Versions
========

Starting from ``v1.0.0``, ``scargo`` adopts the `semantic versioning specification <https://semver.org/>`_, following the ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`` version number.

There are no support periods defined and bugfixes are not planned, therefore it is strongly recommended to install the latest version possible.

.. note::

    The older version is directed mainly toward package maintainers. Regular users should always use the most recent version of ``scargo`` to benefit from the latest features and bug fixes.
